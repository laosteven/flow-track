## For Coaches

### Viewing a Shared Session (2 easy steps)

1. **Open the link**
   - Click the `flowtrack://` link you received
   - Or open the attached JSON file

2. **Review the session**
   - App opens automatically
   - Tap "View Session" in the dialog
   - All metrics and graphs are ready!

## Example Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Remote Coaching
```
Paddler (in morning) → Records session during practice
                     → Shares link via WhatsApp to coach

Coach (in evening)   → Opens link on their phone
                     → Reviews metrics and technique
                     → Sends feedback via text
```

### Scenario 2: Team Comparison
```
Team Captain → Collects links from all team members
             → Opens each session on their tablet
             → Compares stroke rates and consistency
             → Plans next practice based on data
```

### Scenario 3: Technique Improvement
```
Paddler → Records "before" session
        → Receives coaching feedback
        → Practices adjustments
        → Records "after" session
        → Shares both with coach
Coach   → Compares before/after
        → Confirms improvements
```

## What You Can See

When viewing a shared session, you get access to:

- ✅ Average strokes per minute (SPM)
- ✅ Stroke consistency percentage
- ✅ Total stroke count
- ✅ Average power per stroke
- ✅ Distance covered
- ✅ Speed and split/500m
- ✅ Time-series graphs for all metrics
- ✅ Session name and paddler name
- ✅ Date and time of session

## Requirements

- **Both paddler and coach need the Flow Track app installed**
- **Internet is NOT required** - sharing works offline
- **Supports:** WhatsApp, Email, Telegram, SMS, and any messaging app

## Troubleshooting

### Link doesn't open the app?
- Make sure Flow Track app is installed
- Try tapping the link again
- If that fails, download the JSON file attachment and open it

### Can't share long sessions?
- For very long sessions (30+ minutes), the JSON file attachment is your best option
- The deep link has size limits on some platforms

### Want to keep sessions private?
- Only share links with people you trust
- Shared data includes all session details
- Delete old shared messages if needed

## Tips

💡 **Add a paddler name** before sharing - makes it easier for coaches to identify  
💡 **Share immediately** after good sessions - while technique is fresh  
💡 **Use the JSON file** for archiving or importing to other tools  
💡 **Test first** - share a session to yourself to see how it works
